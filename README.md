# Notes

Have you ever wondered why we talk of "spelling"? There is a spell word
implanted in the brain of every English-speaking child, the root mantra of
restriction, the secret name of a mighty hidden demon:

"eybeesee-dee-ee-effgeeaitcheye-jai-kayell-emenn-ohpeequeue-are-ess-tee-youveedouble-you-exwyezed".

That name and all the names it generates were designed to set
limits upon humanity's ability to express abstract thought. What you see depends
entirely upon the words you have to describe what you see. Nothing
exists unless we say it.

-Sir Miles Delacourt. Invisibles #19 vol.1.

Name Bok comes from the Icelandic word BÃ³k, which means 'book'.
